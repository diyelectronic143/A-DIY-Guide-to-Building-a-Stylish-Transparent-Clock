## A DIY Guide to Building a Stylish Transparent Clock:
Hey everyone, in today's article, I'll be sharing my journey of creating a unique transparent clock. Before we dive into the details, let me give you some insight into how this idea originated. Despite the rapid advancements in technology, my house still sports a classic analog clock, and in a few rooms, a digital one. However, I wanted something distinct for my desk ‚Äì a transparent clock that would set my workspace apart. After brainstorming for a while, I had an epiphany ‚Äì why not craft a transparent clock myself?

Before we delve into the nitty-gritty, let me briefly explain how I brought this transparent clock to life. Creating a clock with 100% visible digital transparency proved to be a formidable challenge, at least for me. After several hours of contemplation and research, I stumbled upon the solution ‚Äì a transparent OLED Display by DF Robot

## Introducing the Transparent OLED Display:
I came across a remarkable 1.51‚Äù SSD1309 transparent monochrome OLED display (light blue) along with a converter from DF Robot.

This display boasts a resolution of 128√ó64, with a transparent area measuring 128√ó56 (a small non-transparent section near the pins can still display content). The full-view, blue display caught my attention.

- After investing significant time in research, this discovery truly stood out. Given its compact size and my desk's dimensions, it seemed like a perfect fit for creating my transparent clock. After all, it wouldn't make sense to have a massive clock dominating my desk due to limited space constraints üòÖüòÇ

## Essential Components:

To bring this transparent clock to life, I gathered the necessary components. First and foremost, an OLED transparent display with a converter was essential. For the brain of the operation, I opted for an Arduino Nano. Why the Nano? Its compact form aligns with my project's requirements. Lastly, the Real Time Clock (RTC) module played a crucial role. As its name suggests, the RTC ensures accurate timekeeping.

For those aiming for a sleeker design, a custom PCB would be ideal. While I'm currently building this clock on a breadboard due to time constraints, I plan to design a custom PCB using EasyEDA in the near future. Once the PCB design is ready, I'll place an order through my favorite platform, JLCPCB.
